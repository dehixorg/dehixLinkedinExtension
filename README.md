# 🚀 LinkedIn Content Moderation Extension

A Chrome extension that helps clean up your LinkedIn experience by hiding spammy or suspicious posts and users — directly in your feed.

---

## ✨ What This Extension Does

- 🧹 **Hide spammy posts and users** from your LinkedIn feed automatically.
- 🚫 **Block specific users or posts** so you never see content from them again.
- ⚠️ **Mark suspicious posts/users** with a visual indicator (like a spam icon) so you can decide what to ignore.
- 🎛️ **Toggle filters** for hiding fake posts or suspicious content using extension popup settings.
- 🔍 **Minimal API calls**, optimized to only fetch block lists when necessary.
- 💾 **Settings saved** using Chrome Storage, so your preferences persist across sessions.

> The extension enhances your LinkedIn feed without needing manual cleanup. Whether it's obvious spam or subtle manipulation, you're in control.
